## Requirements

All required libraries are packed in public/lib.

[d3.js](https://d3js.org/)

Besides that just run npm install in the root directory and be done with it :)

## Usage
You can access this app [here](https://spectral-data.herokuapp.com/)

There are options to calculate the continum, continum removed spectra and first derivatives.

The continum removal is based on the paper [Reflectance spectroscopy: Quantitative analysis techniques for remote sensing applications](https://doi.org/10.1029/JB089iB07p06329)

For the derivatives we thank [Pavel Holoborodko](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/smooth-low-noise-differentiators/) for the insights on how to differentiate numerical noisy data. The guy knows his stuff!

If you want to run it locally just serve the public folder with a http server of your choice. Other option is to use a node server to host the express app (root folder).
